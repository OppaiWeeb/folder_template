# EPITECH FOLDER TEMPLATE

This is a folder template generator based on the epitech C p00l with the header that may be out-dated when used so check your norme to be sure

## install step:
You only need to use 
```sh
    ./install.sh
```
and make sure that .local/bin is in executable path
and also to copy your lib into the .local/share/template_tek/ directory

after this you just need to exec
```sh
    template_tek
```
in the folder that you just clone from your epitech promotion repository

If maybe you want to check if there is an update, I just add the "-u" features that check if the script is up-to-date
```sh
    template_tek -u
```
and it also going to check if the lib is up-to-date
